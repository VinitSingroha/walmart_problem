The algorithm implemented in find_best_delivery_route is an optimized approach to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), known as the Held-Karp algorithm. It efficiently finds the shortest route for a delivery vehicle to visit each customer exactly once and return to the depot. This is achieved through dynamic programming, where the algorithm recursively evaluates all possible combinations of customer visits, memoizes intermediate results to avoid redundant computations, and selects the route with the minimum total distance.
